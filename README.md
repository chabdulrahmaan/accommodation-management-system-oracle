   -- Define the base path for SQL files
   DEFINE base_path = 'F:/Downloads/accommodation-management-system'
   ```
3. Execute the `main.sql` file in your Oracle Database Management System (DBMS) to create the database schema, insert initial data, add constraints, create indexes, and create views.
